#     dependency-graph JSONL audit.
#
# Plants the canonical completed-dependency shape with nothing but
# public CLI commands: an open issue whose only `blocks` dependency
# targets a blocker that has since been closed. The edge is SATISFIED
# (its blocker is present and terminal) AND the open issue is fully
# unblocked, so one planted state exercises both detect-only checks in
# their #432 benign form:
#   - dep.dead_closed_blocking_edges  (ok + satisfied_blockers details)
#   - dep.fully_unblocked_open        (ok + ready details)
