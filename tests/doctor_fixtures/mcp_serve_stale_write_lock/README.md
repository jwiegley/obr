# mcp_serve_stale_write_lock

- **FM**: `fm-agent_coordination-mcp-serve-stale-write-lock`
- **Covered by live detector**: `write_lock` /
  `fm-concurrency_primitives-orphaned-write-lock`
- **Detect**: plants an old `.obr/.write.lock` plus an orphan
  `.write.lock.holder.pid` sidecar, matching the shape left behind by a killed
  long-running `obr serve` process. Doctor must classify the lock inode `ok`
  with `details.reason == "probe_acquired_free"`: process exit already released
  the OS advisory lock, so a non-blocking probe acquires it, and the leftover
  inode wedges nothing.
- **obr-m6m — the reason string changed, and why that is a correction**: this
  used to demand `details.reason == "persistent_advisory_inode"`. That string
  is emitted nowhere in `src/` and never was; `docs/DECISIONS.md`
  lists it under "Born-broken tests" as a never-implemented classification. The
  implemented vocabulary is `probe_acquired_free` /
  `probe_would_block_live_holder` / `stale_mtime`, and `probe_acquired_free` is
  the right answer for an unheld old lock. The fixture only appeared to be
  checking anything real because a plain `obr doctor` held the workspace write
  lock while probing it, so the probe collided with its own caller. Read-only
  doctor no longer takes that lock, so the probe answers honestly and the
  fixture now pins the FREE branch by name.
- **Repair contract**: doctor must not move, remove, or rewrite either lock
  artifact automatically. The fixture proves device+inode identity across
  detect, repair, and undo; a subsequent real mutation proves the old inode
  does not wedge the workspace.
- **Round-trip**: no chokepointed mutation is expected. `doctor undo` is a
  no-op for this fixture, and the lock artifacts remain present.
- **Expected exit codes**:
    - detect: 0
    - repair: 0
    - undo: 0 or 2

The original skeleton expected `doctor --fix --only
fm-agent_coordination-mcp-serve-stale-write-lock` to quarantine the lock.
That would be unsafe: moving the file could split future lockers onto a new
inode while an existing process still believes it owns the old one. Actual
live ownership is classified by startup lock acquisition, not file age.
